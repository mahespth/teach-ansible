# Red Hat Satellite Hammer CLI cheatsheet

This folder contains a refreshed Hammer CLI cheatsheet for current Red Hat Satellite releases (Satellite 6.14+ / hammer 3.x at the time of writing). It updates the older Red Hat article 2258471 and highlights commonly used commands with modern flags and defaults.

Author: **Steve Maher**  
Role: **DevOps Engineer specialising in infrastructure with Ansible**

The goal is to provide a fast, reliable reference:

- Quick authentication options and defaults
- Frequently used host, content, and lifecycle commands
- Outputs you can paste directly into scripts or runbooks

Docs are Markdown pages intended for:

- Viewing directly in GitHub (or GitHub Pages)
- Local browsing and editing in VS Code
