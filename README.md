This repository contains documentation and examples for teaching Ansible.

Author: **Steve Maher**  
Role: **DevOps Engineer specialising in infrastructure with Ansible**

The goal of this project is to provide a clear, practical reference that goes from:

- Basic selectors and simple examples
- Through real Ansible module outputs and facts
- To complex, deeply nested data structures that commonly trip people up

The docs are written as Markdown pages intended for:

- Viewing directly in GitHub (or GitHub Pages)
- Local browsing and editing in VS Code
